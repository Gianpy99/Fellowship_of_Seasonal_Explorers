# Feature Specification: Seasonal Quest App for Family Education

**Feature Branch**: `001-seasonal-quest-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Educational seasonal exploration app for families and kids with AI-powered quest recommendations, photo journaling, and gamification to encourage outdoor discovery and learning about seasonal nature and food"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Discover and Complete Seasonal Quests with Virtual Exploration (Priority: P1)

Families browse seasonal quests on an interactive Google Maps interface and explore quest locations virtually using Street View before (or instead of) visiting physically. Children can "walk" through Calabrian markets or English orchards from their home computer, learning geography and seasonal products through immersive exploration. Quest completion supports multiple methods: virtual Street View exploration, GPS check-in (when available on desktop), or webcam photo verification.

**Why this priority**: This is the core educational experience combining geography, seasonal learning, and virtual exploration. The Google Maps Street View integration makes quests accessible without physical travel, dramatically expanding educational opportunities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading a quest on Google Maps, navigating Street View to explore the location, capturing a webcam photo of a seasonal product (brought home from market), and reading educational content. Delivers standalone value of complete virtual + physical learning experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a child opens the app in autumn, **When** they view the home screen, **Then** they see a Google Map with 10-20 seasonal quest markers (custom fruit/vegetable icons) centered on their region
2. **Given** a quest marker is clicked, **When** the quest detail loads, **Then** the screen shows quest description, educational content, and an embedded Street View of the location (e.g., Reggio Calabria market for bergamotto)
3. **Given** a child wants to explore virtually, **When** they click "Explore in Street View", **Then** they can navigate using arrow keys or mouse to "walk" around the farmers market, orchard, or garden
4. **Given** a family finds a seasonal product at their local market, **When** they bring it home and click "Complete Quest", **Then** the app activates the webcam for photo capture with the product
5. **Given** a quest is completed via Street View exploration + photo, **When** submission succeeds, **Then** the app marks the quest complete, displays congratulatory message with educational facts, and awards appropriate badge
6. **Given** browser Geolocation API is available (WiFi-based on desktop), **When** the user enables GPS check-in, **Then** the app shows proximity indicator ("You are within 500m of quest location") as optional verification
7. **Given** browser Geolocation is unavailable or inaccurate, **When** the user attempts GPS check-in, **Then** the app gracefully falls back with message "GPS non disponibile su questo computer, usa Street View per esplorare!"
8. **Given** educational content is displayed alongside Street View, **When** a child under 10 is using the app, **Then** the language is simple, engaging, and age-appropriate with visual aids showing where products grow

**Platform Context**: Web app on desktop/laptop (family computer), keyboard + mouse navigation, large click targets (48x48px minimum)

### User Story 2 - Track Progress and Earn Badges (Priority: P2)

Children earn badges and track their seasonal exploration progress through a visual dashboard showing completed quests, seasonal milestones, and achievement streaks. This motivates continued engagement and creates a sense of accomplishment.

**Why this priority**: Gamification significantly increases engagement and learning retention for children, but the app can function without it for initial educational value.

**Independent Test**: Complete multiple quests and verify badges are awarded correctly, progress is accurately tracked, and the visual dashboard displays achievements clearly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a child completes their first quest, **When** they view their profile, **Then** they see a "First Explorer" badge and a progress indicator showing 1 quest completed
2. **Given** a family completes quests for 3 consecutive days, **When** they check their streak, **Then** they see a 3-day streak indicator and encouraging message
3. **Given** a child completes all autumn quests, **When** the seasonal milestone is reached, **Then** they unlock a special "Autumn Master" badge with celebratory animation
4. **Given** a parent wants to review their child's learning, **When** they view the progress dashboard, **Then** they see a summary of topics explored (fruits, vegetables, flowers, etc.) with educational highlights

### User Story 3 - AI-Powered Personalized Quest Recommendations (Priority: P3)

The app uses AI (Gemini) to suggest quests based on the family's location, weather conditions, completed activities, and the child's interests. Recommendations adapt to create an optimal learning journey.

**Why this priority**: Personalization enhances the experience but isn't required for basic functionality. The app can work with static seasonal quest packs initially.

**Independent Test**: Complete several quests, change location/weather conditions, and verify that AI recommendations adapt appropriately and suggest relevant new quests.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a family has completed several fruit-related quests, **When** they request new recommendations, **Then** the AI suggests complementary vegetable or flower quests to diversify learning
2. **Given** it's a rainy day, **When** the app checks weather conditions, **Then** it prioritizes indoor market-based quests or postpones outdoor nature quests
3. **Given** a family is in Calabria during bergamot season (November-March), **When** they view recommendations, **Then** the AI highlights bergamot-related quests with local cultural context
4. **Given** AI generates a recommendation, **When** the content is displayed, **Then** it includes family-friendly educational text explaining why this quest is a good match

---

### User Story 4 - Create and Share Photo Journals (Priority: P3)

Families create photo journals documenting their seasonal discoveries with captions and reflections. These can be kept private for family memories or shared within a small trusted circle.

**Why this priority**: Journaling deepens learning and creates lasting memories, but basic quest completion provides the primary educational value.

**Independent Test**: Complete a quest, create a journal entry with photos and text, save it privately, and optionally share with family members.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a child completes a quest about autumn apples, **When** they create a journal entry, **Then** they can add multiple photos, a title, and simple text notes
2. **Given** a parent reviews a journal entry, **When** they view it, **Then** they see the photos, notes, location, date, and associated educational content
3. **Given** a family wants to preserve memories, **When** they export their journal, **Then** they receive a shareable format (PDF or photo album) with all entries
4. **Given** privacy is important, **When** journal entries are created, **Then** all data is stored locally by default with explicit opt-in for any sharing

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a quest location is no longer accessible (closed venue, private property)? The system should allow users to report issues and suggest alternative locations or mark quests as temporarily unavailable.
- How does the system handle families traveling between regions (Calabria to England)? Quest packs should automatically switch based on detected location, maintaining progress across regions.
- What happens when a child tries to complete a quest that's out of season? The app should gently educate about seasonality and suggest appropriate current-season alternatives.
- How does the system work without internet connectivity? All core features (viewing quests, taking photos, journaling) must work offline with data syncing when connection is restored.
- What happens when multiple family members use the same device? The app should support simple profile switching or family account mode where progress is shared.
- How does the app handle inappropriate photo content? Since it's for family use, include optional parental review mode before photos are saved to journals.
