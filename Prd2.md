## 1) Problem Statement
People who enjoy outdoor exploration or seasonal travel often lack a centralized platform to discover, track, and share seasonal adventures tailored to the time of year and location. Current solutions are fragmented and don’t combine personalized suggestions with social engagement. There is a need for a platform that motivates seasonal exploration and fosters a community of like-minded adventurers.

---

## 2) Goals & Objectives
- **Provide seasonal activity suggestions** based on location, weather, and personal preferences.  
- **Track and share explorations** with friends or community.  
- **Gamify seasonal exploration** to encourage regular outdoor activity.  
- **Support multi-platform access** (mobile, web) for on-the-go usage.  
- **Enable social features** like friend lists, badges, and challenges.

---

## 3) Target Users
- Outdoor enthusiasts and hobby travelers.  
- Families and friend groups seeking seasonal activities.  
- Adventure clubs and community groups.  

---

## 4) Core Features

### MVP
1. **Seasonal Activity Recommendations** (hikes, walks, seasonal events, nature spots).  
2. **Activity Logging & Tracking** with optional photos and notes.  
3. **Personalized Calendar** with reminders for seasonal activities.  
4. **Basic Social Sharing** (friends, community feed).  
5. **Profile & Badges** for completed activities.

### Phase 2
6. **Gamification Elements:** challenges, points, leaderboards.  
7. **Weather Integration** for location-specific suggestions.  
8. **Custom Groups** to explore activities with friends or clubs.  

### Phase 3

## 5) Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Quick loading of recommendations (<2s) and smooth map integration.  
- **Reliability:** Sync between devices and offline mode for remote locations.  
- **Security:** Privacy controls for sharing location and activities.  
- **Accessibility:** Mobile-first, responsive UI with accessibility compliance.

---

## 6) Constraints
- Seasonal data must be curated and kept up-to-date.  
- Some activities may require third-party APIs for weather or maps.  

---

## 7) Tech Stack Suggestion
- **Frontend:** React Native (mobile) or Flutter.  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express or FastAPI.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data, Firebase for real-time feeds.  
- **Maps & Location:** Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap.  
- **AI Recommendations:** Python-based ML service for personalization.

---

## 8) Success Metrics
- ≥60% of users log ≥1 activity per week during peak seasons.  
- ≥50% engagement with social features (likes, comments, shares).  
- High retention across seasons (≥3 seasons active/year).  
- Positive user ratings on activity suggestions (>4/5).

## 9) Roadmap

| Phase     | Duration  | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|

| **Phase 2** | +4 weeks | Gamification, weather integration, custom groups |
| **Phase 3** | +6 weeks | AI-driven suggestions, maps integration, event creation |

---

## 10) Risks & Mitigation
- **Low user adoption:** Gamify activities and provide initial seasonal content library.  
- **Data accuracy:** Use verified sources for seasonal recommendations.  
- **Privacy concerns:** Allow users to control location sharing and visibility.

---

## 11) Open Questions
- Should the app **focus globally** or start region-specific?  
- How many **initial seasonal activities** should MVP include?  
- Level of **AI personalization** required at launch?
